# Weather-monitoring-station-using-LabVIEW-and-Arduino
For a long time, weather monitoring was largely a pastime of enthusiastic amateurs, but over the last century, it has evolved into a well-organized and professional global activity that reflects its crucial importance in wide range of economic, environmental, civil protection and agricultural activities. The main objective of this project is to monitor various weather parameters such as temperature, pressure, humidity, and wind speed, light intensity etcetera and intimate to the concerned control authorities. To implement this, we use various sensors interfaced to the Arduino, to monitor the mentioned attributes and collect and store the data. 

The Arduino is interfaced to the LabVIEW so that the data can be displayed on the front panel. All the above attributes can be recorded in real time and any abnormal pattern traced, can immediately be taken care of, by the respective bodies on intimation or an alert in some cases and appropriate precautionary measures can be deployed. As a result, the implemented weather monitoring system serves as an economical, accurate and reliable solution for weather prediction. Weather monitoring is not just about defining the present climate, but also to predict changes in the weather. Weather forecasting finds its applications in diverse fields like agriculture, renewable energy surveys, outdoor sports, research related monitoring etcetera.
